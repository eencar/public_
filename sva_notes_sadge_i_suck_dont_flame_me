# 5.4 S_eventually property
I wonder if s_eventually can be used in the antecedent in order to "kick-off"
a start condition or watch for some event.

* s_eventually property
1. 
		p is true in clock tick i if and only if p is true in some clock tick
		j >= i.

	 1. similar to the (always p) property. (s_eventually) defines a series of
			evaluations of p however in order for to pass only of the the chances
			has to pass.

	 2. I don't think this can actually fail. Since this assertion can technically pass
			sometime later, the simulator can only know in continuous time, not discrete time.
			As in FV. However if it never starts, the absence of it can tell us more about a
			potental problem  in the design.

			- If you are describing a situation that needs to happen as in a requirement.
				The lack of firing implies that requirement never asserted. Thus not invalided,
				but needs to be further thought through.

	 3. What does (s_eventually always p) mean?
			- There exist some clock tick where always p is true.
			- P is true from some clock tick on. (another viewpoint)
				
	 4. Compare the following properties

			- [a2] #--> This checks at that rst at some moment becomes low and stays low.
			- assert property
				- @(posedge clk) s_eventually always !rst);
					
			- [a1]
			- assert property #--> This only checks that rst at some point goes low.
				- @(posedge clk) s_eventually !rst

			-
